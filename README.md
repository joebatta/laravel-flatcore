# (WIP) Flatcore

Laravel is awesome, but sometimes we just need some flat-file usage. Specially small projects. So I did, inspired
by [Aloia](https://aloiacms.com/) that I now sometimes use for likewise projects.

## Getting Started
**1. Install Flatcore**
```shell

```

**2. Publish config**
```shell

```

## Usage

### Configs

**Extension:** .yml  
**Default path:** `./content/configs/{config}.yml`

### Models

**Extension:** .md  
**Default path:** `./content/models/{model_folder}/*.md`

Models is essentially a collection, or better known as a table. Each folder is a table and the files are records.
